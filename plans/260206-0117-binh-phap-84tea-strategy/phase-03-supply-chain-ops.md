# Phase 03: Supply Chain & Operations

**Status:** Pending
**Priority:** High
**Duration:** 8 Weeks

## Context
Logistics is the backbone of the franchise. We need to move tea from Vietnam to SG/TH/MY efficiently, minimizing tariffs (ATIGA) and spoilage. The "Central Kitchen" in Vietnam acts as the manufacturing hub.

## Key Insights (from Research)
- **Dry Cargo Focus:** Prioritize exporting dry tea/powder to keep logistics costs < 15%.
- **Local Sourcing:** Source milk/ice/fruit locally in target markets.
- **POS Integration:** Don't fight the local POS leaders; integrate with them.

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Central Kitchen (Vietnam)
- [ ] **Facility Setup:**
    - Equipment for tea blending and packing.
    - QA Lab for batch testing.
- [ ] **Sourcing:**
    - Contract farming agreements with Shan Tuyết tea growers (Ha Giang/Yen Bai).
    - Supplier selection for packaging (cups, lids) - consider eco-friendly options.

### 2. Logistics & Export
- [ ] **Logistics Partner:**
    - Select freight forwarder with SEA expertise (e.g., DHL, DB Schenker, or regional specialists).
- [ ] **Regulatory:**
    - Register products with FDA Thailand.
    - Prepare "Master File" for exports (CO Form D for ATIGA 0% tax).
- [ ] **Inventory Planning:**
    - Define "Safety Stock" levels for Regional Hubs (SG/TH).
    - Map lead times (Door-to-Door).

### 3. Operational Tech Integration
- [ ] **POS Configuration:**
    - Create standard "Menu Matrix" (SKUs, Modifiers, Prices) for import into local POS.
    - Test "End of Day" sales sync to FMS.
- [ ] **Hardware Standard:**
    - Define "Approved Hardware List" for franchisees (Printers, KDS, Tablets).

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Central Kitchen operational and passed hygiene audit.
- [ ] First test shipment (Dry Container) clears customs in Singapore.
- [ ] Supply contracts signed with 3 major tea farmers.
- [ ] POS Menu Matrix standardized and verified.

## Risk Assessment
- **Risk:** Customs delays due to documentation.
    - *Mitigation:* Hire experienced customs broker; double-check Form D.
- **Risk:** Ingredient inconsistency.
    - *Mitigation:* Strict SOPs at Central Kitchen; batch retention samples.
