# Phase 01: Foundation & Compliance

**Status:** Completed
**Priority:** Critical
**Duration:** 8 Weeks

## Context
Before writing code or shipping tea, we must establish the legal and visual foundation. Exporting food to SG/MY requires strict compliance (SFA/Halal). The brand identity must be standardized for franchising using Material Design 3.

## Key Insights (from Research)
- **Halal is mandatory** for Malaysia and huge advantage in Singapore/Indonesia. Process takes 6+ months, start NOW.
- **SFA (Singapore)** is the "Gold Standard". Passing their pesticide tests validates quality for the whole region.
- **MD3** provides a scalable design language that ensures consistency across apps, kiosks, and marketing.

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Legal & Certifications
- [ ] **Trademark Search & Registration:**
    - File via Madrid Protocol for SG, TH, MY, VN.
- [ ] **Halal Certification (Vietnam):**
    - Audit Central Kitchen/Processing facility.
    - Submit application to HCA or HVCN (ensure JAKIM/MUI recognition).
- [ ] **Product Testing (SFA Standards):**
    - Send tea samples to Eurofins/SGS for MRL (Maximum Residue Limits) testing.
    - Adjust sourcing if pesticide levels exceed SFA limits.

### 2. Brand Identity & Design System
- [ ] **Brand Guidelines 2.0:**
    - Define "Ancient Tea" narrative (Story of 100+ year old trees).
    - Finalize Tone of Voice (Premium, Zen, Authentic).
- [ ] **MD3 Design System Setup:**
    - Create Figma UI Kit based on MD3 (Imperial Green & Gold Leaf).
    - Define Token Mapping (Color, Typography, Elevation) for development.
    - Design key assets: Logo variants, Cup packaging, Menu boards.

### 3. Franchise Legal Framework
- [ ] **Master Franchise Agreement (MFA):**
    - Draft template for SEA markets.
    - Define Royalty Fee (e.g., 5%) and Marketing Fund (e.g., 2%).
- [ ] **Operations Manual (SOP):**
    - Draft "Tea Brewing Standard" (Temp, Time, Ratio).
    - Draft "Service Standard" (Greeting, Serving).

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Trademark application filed in 4 countries.
- [ ] Halal application accepted and audit scheduled.
- [ ] Tea samples pass SFA MRL standards.
- [ ] MD3 Figma UI Kit complete and handed off to devs.

## Risk Assessment
- **Risk:** Tea samples fail pesticide test.
    - *Mitigation:* Source from certified organic farms; pre-test continuously.
- **Risk:** Halal certification delays.
    - *Mitigation:* Hire a dedicated Halal consultant to expedite.
