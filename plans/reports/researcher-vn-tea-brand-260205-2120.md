# Research Report: 84tea Brand Identity & SEA Market Strategy
**Date:** 2026-02-05
**Context:** Vietnamese Ancient Tea (Shan Tuyet) Brand for SEA Franchise
**Framework:** Material Design 3 (MD3) + Indochine Luxury

## 1. Cultural Design Insights (Vietnam & Ancient Tea)
*   **Symbolism of "Imperial Green" (#1B5E20):** Connects directly to the *Shan Tuyet* (Snow Shan) ancient tea leaves found in Ha Giang/Yen Bai. Distinct from the brighter "matcha green" of Japanese brands or the "emerald" of Highlands. Represents longevity, resilience, and the primeval forests.
*   **Symbolism of "Gold Leaf" (#C5A962):** References the "golden camellia" (Chè Vàng) and the royal history of tea tributes. In Vietnamese culture (Mộc element), Green supports Fire, but Gold (Metal) cuts Wood; however, here it represents the *result* (the golden brew, prosperity).
*   **"Ivory Silk" Background:** Moves away from clinical white (Western modernism) to a warmer, organic base inspired by raw silk (lụa tơ tằm) and unbleached washi paper, fitting the "Ancient" narrative.
*   **Typography:** *Playfair Display* (Serif) evokes French Indochine heritage, balancing the modern *Inter* (Sans).

## 2. SEA Market Franchise Standards (SG, MY, TH)
*   **Trend:** "Modern Zen" & "Biophilic Design" dominate premium segments (e.g., CHICHA San Chen, Koi Thé Signature).
*   **Format Standards:**
    *   **Kiosk (10-15m²):** Focus on verticality and speed. Digital menu boards are mandatory. "Instagrammable corner" even in small spaces is crucial for Singapore/Thailand markets.
    *   **Express (25-40m²):** Open bar concept. "Tea extraction" must be visible (theatre of making).
    *   **Lounge (50-80m²):** "Third Place" styling. Low seating, natural materials (rattan, bamboo, wood) mixed with brass.
*   **Materiality:** Shift from industrial chic (concrete/steel) to "Warm Minimalism" (wood, stone, textured plaster).

## 3. Brand Voice Guidelines
*   **Tone:** "Reverent but Accessible" (Tôn trọng nhưng Gần gũi).
*   **Vietnamese:** Use honorifics subtly ("Dạ/Thưa") without being archaic. Keywords: *Tinh hoa*, *Nguyên bản*, *Thức tỉnh*.
*   **English:** Premium international English (Singapore standard). Avoid direct translations. Use evocative descriptors: *Ancient, Wild-grown, Mist-covered*.
*   **Tagline Direction:** "Ancient Tea, Modern Spirit" or "The Soul of Vietnam's Mountains".

## 4. Image Style Guidelines
*   **Product Photography:**
    *   **Lighting:** Chiaroscuro (high contrast) to highlight tea liquor clarity and leaf texture.
    *   **Props:** Minimalist ceramics, raw ingredients (star anise, cinnamon), natural stone surfaces.
    *   **Rule:** No artificial "splash" effects; focus on steam and pouring dynamics.
*   **Store Aesthetics (ArchViz):**
    *   **Composition:** Symmetrical, centered perspective (Wes Anderson meets Zen).
    *   **Human Element:** Staff in uniform (modern Ao Dai or minimal linen aprons) engaged in precision work.

## 5. Competitive Positioning
*   **Phuc Long:** Mass market, strong coffee association. **84tea distinction:** Pure tea focus, premium "Ancient" positioning, healthier/organic angle.
*   **Highlands:** Commercial, fast-paced. **84tea distinction:** Slower "Lounge" experience, heritage story vs. street corner convenience.
*   **Gong Cha / Koi:** Bubble tea focused, playful. **84tea distinction:** "Real Tea" (Authentic leaves vs. powders/syrups), sophisticated toppings (aloe, lotus seed) vs. tapioca.
*   **TWG (Aspirational):** Ultra-luxury. **84tea distinction:** Accessible luxury (Masstige), modern tech-forward (MD3 app), Vietnamese soul.

## 6. Recommendations
1.  **Material Design 3 Adaptation:** Use the "Surface Variant" colors extensively for menu cards to separate tiered pricing without clutter.
2.  **Packaging:** Cup design must be iconic (like Starbucks' siren or Gong Cha's red). Suggest: A "frosted" semi-transparent cup to show tea gradient, with Gold Leaf logo vertical alignment.
3.  **Digital First:** The "Order Ahead" UI in the app should be the primary touchpoint, using MD3 motion for transitions (fluid, not instant).

**Status:** Research Complete. Ready for Design System implementation.
**Unresolved:** Specific sustainable packaging vendor sourcing for SEA region.
